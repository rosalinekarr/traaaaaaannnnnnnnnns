Traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns, a.k.a. TransyTalk, is a meme-centric community for trans people. We started as a subreddit, then we branched out into more subreddits, a discord server, and now we have a domain name. We're not really sure what we're going to use this domain for yet, but in the mean time, here's a bunch of handy links:

- [Meme Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns "Where it all began")
- [Chat Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TransyTalk "Talking about transy shit")
- [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/6Akr65p "Information overload")
- [Contribute on Github](https://www.github.com/rosalinekarr/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns "Pls help")
